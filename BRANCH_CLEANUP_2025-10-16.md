git branch -D <branch-name>
```
**Result:** Deleted 21 local branches

### 2. Remote Branch Cleanup
```bash
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```
**Result:** Deleted 21 remote branches from GitHub

### 3. Prune Stale References
```bash
git fetch origin --prune
```
**Result:** Removed stale remote tracking references

## Current State

### Branches Remaining
- `main` (only branch)

### Remote Branches
- `origin/main` (only remote branch)

## Verification

```bash
$ git branch -a
* main
  remotes/origin/main
```

✅ **Clean!** Repository now has a clean branch structure with only the main branch.

## Why This Was Done

1. **Reduced clutter** - No stale branches to confuse development
2. **Clear history** - Only active branches visible
3. **Best practice** - Delete merged branches after PR completion
4. **GitHub hygiene** - Keeps repository organized
