- ✅ **Cloudflare Worker:** Deployed automatically via GitHub Actions
- ✅ **PR Merged:** October 28, 2025

### Test Results:
EC2 status endpoint tested and working:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "repositories": [
    {
      "repo": "ido",
      "currentHash": "ef70288f0075aca58fefe4c16486b9be086bc0a9",
      "commitDate": "2025-10-26T21:34:23+02:00"
    },
    {
      "repo": "epo",
      "currentHash": "63f4bca1d534c428af9084bd56c555534ca37c1d",
      "commitDate": "2021-07-19T10:21:13-05:00"
    },
    {
      "repo": "bilingual",
      "currentHash": "8e8132eafdbc34b80e911cab235486edbbf2f97c",
      "commitDate": "2025-10-27T13:32:10+02:00"
